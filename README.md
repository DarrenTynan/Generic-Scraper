# Generic Web Scraper in Javascript

I have been experimenting with web scraping of late, trying out different methods and seeing what is the best for speed and ease of use.

# Libraries used

 - Axios
 - Cheerio
 - Request-Promise

# Modules
Proxy Generator: scrape sslproxies.org for a list of proxies to use (selected at random).

# Models
MongooseDB Schema models

# Main File
I will create a new file per scrape target url. As an example is st_helens_axios.js and the process will be similar for all targets.
